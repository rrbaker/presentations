## Git, Github, and USAID's More Agile Online Engagement Strategies

This presentation to internal USAID staff interested in technology and/or online engagement focused on a brief and non-technical introduction to what git and github is but with most of the time about how, in the first six months since its launch, USAID is using [its own github.com](http://github.com/usaid) account. This includes the work done with our [Feedback repo](http://github.com/usaid/feedback) to solicit general, public input via issues and our [Projects repo](http://github.com/usaid/projects) to help solicit feedback and help about generating an API for [AidTracker Lite](http://map.usaid.gov). Additionally we're interested in other projects using USAID data in this space and how we can help, such as [evanbsmith's] [USAID Forecast Data] ([and repo]()).
