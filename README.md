#### About

Recently I've been trying to move my public and internal-for-staff presentations into the browser over Powerpoint or Keynote, mostly because I'm a nerd, I like to use nice typography in my presentations which falls apart in giving moving it to other computers, and the constant worry of forgetting the Thunderbolt-to-VGA dongle when I can use my own computer.

All of the presentations here are made possible by the great, FOSS [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/hakimel/reveal.js.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/hakimel/reveal.js) project by [http://hakim.se](Hakim El Hattab).
