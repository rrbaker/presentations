## Presentations

### About

Recently I've been trying to move my public and internal-for-staff presentations into the browser over Powerpoint or Keynote, mostly because I'm a nerd, I like to use nice typography in my presentations which falls apart in giving moving it to other computers, and the constant worry of forgetting the Thunderbolt-to-VGA dongle when I can use my own computer.

All of the presentations here are made possible by the great, FOSS [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/hakimel/reveal.js.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/hakimel/reveal.js) project by [http://hakim.se](Hakim El Hattab).


### Presentations included in this repository

##### [Git, Github, and USAID](http://rrbaker.github.io/presentations/20131216-usaid-git)

_Presented 16 November 2013 at USAID for internal staff_

This presentation to internal USAID staff interested in technology and/or online engagement focused on a brief and non-technical introduction to what git and github is but with most of the time about how, in the first six months since its launch, USAID is using [its own github.com](http://github.com/usaid) account. This includes the work done with our [Feedback repo](http://github.com/usaid/feedback) to solicit general, public input via issues and our [Projects repo](http://github.com/usaid/projects) to help solicit feedback and help about generating an API for [AidTracker Lite](http://map.usaid.gov). Additionally we're interested in other projects using USAID data in this space and how we can help, such as [evanbsmith's] [USAID Forecast Data] ([and repo]()).
